Overview:
--------
This project is an attempt to build a digg.com/reddit.com clone.
There are voting widgets that mimic both, i.e. +1/-1 and +1 voting.
It builds upon a number of other module, se below.

AJAX functionality is used for voting if the browser supports it
(using drupal.js included in Druapl 4.7). Bookmarklets are supported
for quickly submitting new story links. A number of RSS feeds are
available.

This is not a point and click solution. This project provide the missing
pieces but you need to put them all together. Please try it out and
report back with bug you find and suggestions you have.

Installation and configuration:
------------------------------
You first need to install the following modules:
* Links Package http://drupal.org/node/24719
* Voting API http://drupal.org/node/36041

To be able to automatically promote story links that have a specified
number of votes to the front page you also need to install: 
* Actions http://drupal.org/project/actions
* Voting Actions http://drupal.org/node/46895

Installation is as simple as creating a directory named 
'vote_up_down' in your 'modules' directory and
copying the modules and the images into it, then 
enabling the modules at 'administer >> modules'.

For configuration options go to 'administer >> settings
>> vote_up_down.


Theme story links:
-----------------
If you use a PHPTemplate theme you can theme story links nodes with a
"node-storylink.tpl.php" file.

An example "node-storylink.tpl.php" and "template.php" is included.
Place them in the folder of your theme. The examples are styled with the
css file "vote_up_down.css" in the vote_up_down module folder.

In "alternative" there are a "node-storylink.tpl.php" for use with the 
"Alternative +1 vote style" (digg style) voting widget.

The example include these functions:
* Make the title an external link to the submitted story.
* Inserts the voting widget directly for greater control.
* Inserts the domain of the submitted story url like "(via example.com)".
* Displays a small user picture above the voting widget.

OBS! When using "node-storylink.tpl.php" you must turn off
"Vote widget display..." in "admin/settings/vote_up_down" to avoid
getting double voting widgets.


Bookmarklet to submit story links:
---------------------------------
javascript:location.href='http://www.example.com/node/add/storylink?edit[url]='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&edit[title]='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)

Replace "www.example.com" with your domain.
